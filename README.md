## Hello, I'm Yavuz Selim Kaya

I am a Computer Engineering student at Gazi University with a strong interest in computer vision, image processing, and embedded systems.  
I work with Python, C++, Java and C# to develop real-time detection, segmentation, and tracking systems.  
I also integrate these systems with Unity and optimize deep learning models using ONNX and TensorRT for deployment on various platforms.  

# Skills and Technologies

I have experience with Python, C++, Java and C#.  
I am proficient in using OpenCV, PyTorch, and Unity for computer vision applications.  
I have hands-on experience with TCP sockets, client-server architectures, and real-time data streaming, particularly in integrating Python and Unity for live visualization.
In addition, I have implemented computer vision solutions using YOLO and similar object detection frameworks for tasks such as real-time detection, tracking, and data visualization.
I am familiar with model optimization techniques such as quantization and pruning, and with tools like ONNX Runtime, TensorRT, and Docker.

## Projects

**Real-Time 3D Visualization with Unity and Python** 

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yselimkaya/back_sault_simulation)  

This project was developed during my internship at Etiqa under the supervision of Ender Erol.  
It integrates Python-based computer vision (OpenCV) with a Unity environment for real-time visualization.  
The Python module handles object detection and tracking, processes live data streams, and sends positional data to Unity via TCP sockets.  
Unity then maps the received coordinates to a human model in real-time, enabling interactive visualization of detection results.
