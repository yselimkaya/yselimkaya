# Hello, I'm Yavuz Selim Kaya

I am a Computer Engineering student at **Gazi University** with a strong interest in computer vision, image processing, and embedded systems.  
I work with Python, C++, Java, and C# to develop real-time detection, segmentation, and tracking systems.  
I also integrate these systems with Unity and optimize deep learning models using ONNX and TensorRT for deployment on various platforms.

## Projects

### Real-Time 3D Visualization with Unity and Python  
[**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/yselimkaya/back_sault_simulation)

Developed during my internship at **Etiqa** under the supervision of **Ender Erol**.  
This project integrates a Python-based computer vision pipeline (OpenCV + YOLO) with a Unity 3D environment for **real-time visualization**.  
The Python module handles object detection and tracking, processes live data streams, and sends positional data to Unity via TCP sockets.  
Unity maps the received coordinates to a 3D human model in real-time, enabling an **interactive visualization** of detection results.
